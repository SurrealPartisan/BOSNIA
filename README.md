BOSNIA, or Better Organization of Standards, Norms, Instructions, and Alternatives (known as Better Committee for Weights and Measures between 2019 and 2025) is an international standardization organization dedicated to the improvement of *everything*. BOSNIA provides the most epic standards for different contexts, topics and situations, for free! The standards are also completely open, and can be updated to cover any future situation. The updating process of the BOSNIA standards is also standardized in the BOSNIA standards.

This is the official repository of BOSNIA, as defined in the standards in this repository. Tautology justifies itself.
