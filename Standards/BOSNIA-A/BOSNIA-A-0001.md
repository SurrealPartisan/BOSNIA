# BOSNIA-A-0001: The defining procedures and structures of BOSNIA standards

## Introduction
This standard defines how BOSNIA standards are created, edited and published. As is typical for standards in the BOSNIA-A category, it is a metastandard that applies to itself.

## Creation and editing rights
Any self-appointed member of BOSNIA is allowed to create and edit BOSNIA standards. BOSNIA membership is defined in the standard BOSNIA-A-0002. When you are a member, you don't need to ask anybody for a permission to create or edit BOSNIA standards. Just go for it! Of course, the administration of [the official BOSNIA repository](../../..), where the standards are published, is completely arbitrary. Thus, you may need to make your own fork and declare it official.

## Tools
* Git
  * *Git* is a synonym of *jerk*, which is a term in physics, defined as the time derivative of acceleration.
  * Git is where the standards are edited and published.
  * Git stores the version history. That is enough. You don't need to mark the standards with dates or version numbers or anything, and also you don't need to make fancy commit messages.
* English
  * It's the language in which the standards are written, at least most of the time, I guess.
  * It's a sort of anti-standard, as there is no unique standard definition of the English language. Use whatever ortography and grammar you like.
* The pre-existing BOSNIA standards
  * If another BOSNIA standard is relevant to the one you are writing, consider following it. No pressure though.

## Standard structure
### Title
The title of a BOSNIA standard consists of two parts: the standard code and the description. The standard code starts with "BOSNIA", followed by a hyphen, followed by the letter of the category to which the standard belongs ("A" for standards defining BOSNIA and its standards and the procedures and rules related to them, "B" for standards regarding the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina and its relation to BOSNIA, "C" for general standards), followed by another hyphen, followed by the number of the standard in its category, left-padded with zeros to four digits ("What if there are over 9999 standards in the category?" Shut up, it's not gonna happen!). The description part of the title is a short piece of text, typically a noun phrase, telling what the standard is about.

### Introduction
A mandatory section, telling what the standard is about, in longer words than the title.

### Other sections
Whatever is needed for the standard.

### License
A mandatory section, containing the BSPL license, defined in [BOSNIA-A-0003](BOSNIA-A-0003.md).

## Publishing
Put the standard in the folder of the appropriate standard category in [the official BOSNIA repository](../../..) as an .md file. The official BOSNIA repository is defined as any Git repository that declares itself as such. Add the standard to the list in the readme file of the repository with a link.

## License
This standard (or document or repository or whatever, let's call it a standard in any case) is licensed with
The better standard public license (BSPL). The license gives you the following rights:

1. Using:
You are free to use the standard, i.e., follow it. In fact, you may be required to do so. Required by whom?
Who knows! But better safe than sorry. So go ahead, use the standard. However, the standard is meant for
improvement of things. Usage against this purpose is not recommended. Better is better.

2. Copying and distributing:
You know, whatever. Spread it any way you want. Selling it for money would be a jerk move, but whatever,
being a jerk is not illegal, and in the official opinion of BOSNIA (Better Organization of Standards, Norms,
Instructions, and Alternatives), it shouldn't be, either. Sometimes you have to be a jerk.

3. Editing:
The standard may be edited by any self-appointed member of BOSNIA. In principle, the proper way to do that
and to appoint yourself as a member are also defined in the BOSNIA standards. However, you can always change
the standards that tell you how to change the standards, so practically you can do whatever.

4. Suing and complaining:
You are not allowed to sue the creators of the standard. You are, however, allowed to complain, but we don't
promise to listen to you.

The BSPL license text is also licensed with BSPL. It's recursive!
